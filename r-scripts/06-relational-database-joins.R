# plot (with a line and points)  how the number of cockles changes with distance along the transect


##### merge the cockle and elevation data into a single table you call "combidat"
# using Distance_ID as the common variable between the two tables

# show in a plot how cockle density changes with elevation

# fit a linear regression

# predicted at 0.5 m (x)
# y = b0 + b1x   (b0 is intercept and b1 is the slope, x is elevation, y is no cockles

# show this model as a line in ggplot, with the confidence interval

# fit a better model, using a loess smoother
# show this model in ggplot

##### plot  how the size (as mean length) of cockles changes with  elevation along the transect
# omit the observations where length is NA (because no cockles were measures)
# fit a quadratic model (second-order polynomial)
# show for each point also the standard errors
# add appropriate labels for the x and y axis
